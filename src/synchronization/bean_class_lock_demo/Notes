Synchronizing any portion of code, is basically making multiple threads access and execute it ONE AT A TIME ONLY.
This needs to be done for shared resources to make code Thread safe. Basically mutable resources(add,update, delete) of objects should have synchronised and others(read) left as it is

1. Synchronized instance method: bean lock until entire instance method executed by current thread
2. Synchronised block : monitor bean lock until entire block executed by current method
3. Synchronised static method : class lock until entire static method executed by current thread.
